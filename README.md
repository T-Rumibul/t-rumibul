# Hi, I’m Andrey 👋

I’m a software developer primarily focused on **modern web applications**, with a strong interest in understanding how things work under the hood.

I enjoy learning beyond my main stack, experimenting with lower-level tooling, and building practical projects that solve real problems.

I’m comfortable working in **remote, async-friendly environments** and value clear communication and maintainable code.

---

## 🚀 Main stack

**Frontend**
- Vue 3 / Nuxt 3
- TypeScript, JavaScript
- Component-based UI architecture

**Backend**
- Node.js
- REST / event-driven applications

**Other (learning & experimentation)**
- C++ (basic / experimental)
- Windows APIs (exploratory usage)
- Rust (learning)

---

## 🧠 What I focus on

- Writing readable, maintainable code
- Understanding trade-offs, not just implementations
- Improving developer experience
- Building things that are easy to reason about
- Learning by building, not just reading

---

## 📌 Selected projects

### 🔹 Portfolio (Nuxt 3)
Personal portfolio built with **Nuxt 3 & Vue**, showcasing my work and experiments.

### 🔹 node-native-win-utils
An **experimental project** exploring how Node.js can interact with native Windows functionality.  
Built mainly for learning and curiosity, not production use.

### 🔹 Idea Of Evil (Discord bot)
A **TypeScript-based Discord bot** demonstrating event-driven design and real-world project structure.

### 🔹 bserializer
A small serialization experiment focused on data handling and structure.

## 📈 What I’m looking for

- **Remote frontend or full-stack roles**
- Vue / TypeScript–centric projects
- Teams that value learning, code quality, and clear communication
- Opportunities to grow as an engineer
